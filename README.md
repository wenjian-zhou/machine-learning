# machine-learning

This is a machine learning library developed by Wenjian Zhou for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

Instructions for running code:
1. For Decision Tree:
excute the code with run.sh, then you will see the prompt and then you could choose the dataset and max_depth to get the train test error for each tree.

2. For ensemble learning:
excute the code with run.sh, (if not working please just try 'python main.py', then the code will excecute)
This time you also need to select which dataset you want to process, then it will automatically run adaboost, bagging, and random forest.
Due to computation limiation, I hardcode the iteration from (1,11) for training in a reasonable time. The figure will be displayed after the excecution.

3. For Linear Regression:
excute the code with run.sh, (if not working please just try 'python main.py', then the code will excecute)
This time you need to select which optimization method you would like to try, then it will automatically run with that method and display figure.
In addition, you could also refer to linear_output.ipynb for the output figure under 'Linear Regression' folder if do not have enough time to run.
